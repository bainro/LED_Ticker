# ESP8266 LED Ticker
Two 8x32 monochrome LED displays in series driven by an ESP8266 to create an LED ticker. The ESP8266 connects to the wifi and hosts a simple local web server. I assigned it a static IP so it can be accessed from the same address each time. The web form it provides is used to set a custom text or to display weather from the open weather map api. The left 3/8 of the display is always a clock.
